# Computational-Physics

Various physics based simulations are implemented here. Currently, the following are implemented:

- Double-Pendulums
- Simple-Nbody

## Double-Pendulums

Language: Rust

Simulation: Double pendulums

## ODE-Solver-Comparison

Language: Python

A performance comparison of different numerical methods of solving systems of ODEs. Currently in the early stages of development.

## Simple-Nbody

Language: Rust

Simulation: N body gravity simulation. Named "Simple" because it directly computes all accelerations produced by all masses, leading to a computationally intensive (but simple to implement) O(n^2) time complexity. Meant as a test bed for a future implementation of the Barnes-Hut algorithm

## Depreciated

Contains various experiments or false starts. Currently not used, but fragments might be brought back if judged to be useful in the future
